# SystemVerilog CPU Implementation
This repository summarizes the project work in CPEN 211 at UBC, where I learned a completely new programming language and built a central processing unit with SystemVerilog. CPEN 211 was the academic highlight of my second year and my introduction to object-oriented programming.  
## Key Components

### Controller

The controller manages instruction execution and control signals, directing the flow of operations within the CPU.

### Datapath

The datapath facilitates data movement and manipulation, serving as the core of the CPU's functionality.

### ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)

The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations, supporting diverse computational tasks.

### RAM (Random Access Memory)

RAM provides volatile memory for efficient data storage and retrieval within the CPU.

### Shifter

The shifter handles bit manipulation, crucial for operations like shifts and rotations.

### D-Flip-Flops

D-flip-flops serve as memory elements, capturing and storing data at specific points in the CPU's operation.

### Multiplexers (Muxes)

Multiplexers route and select different data paths, contributing to the CPU's versatility.
